This repository demonstrates a subtle error in MATLAB related to implicit expansion during element-wise array operations.  The `bug.m` file shows the incorrect implementation that leads to an error. The `bugSolution.m` provides the correct solution, illustrating how to leverage implicit expansion correctly.  This is a useful example for understanding the nuances of implicit expansion and avoiding common pitfalls in MATLAB array manipulations.
